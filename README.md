# Automatic-segmentation-OCT-images-pre-and-post-cataract-surgery-using-deep-learning
Data associated to the paper "Automatic segmentation and quantification of OCT images pre and post cataract surgery using deep learning", in Matlab format.
Run   to obtain results of table 4 of the paper "Comparison of the segmentation accuracy (IoU) of the classical approach and the proposed DL algorithm in the test set for the IOLMaster 700 preoperative images, ANTERION preoperative images, and IOLMaster 700 postoperative images".
Run   to obtain results of table 6 of the paper "Table 6. MeanÂ±STD of the quantified parameters (n=50 eyes for IOLMaster 700 pre and postoperative; n=36 eyes for ANTERION)."
